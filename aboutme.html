    Hi, my name is Nathalie Morales. I am Puerto Rican. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I am a student at BMCC majoring in Animation and Motion Graphics. I am also a mother of two and work full time as a Medical Office Manager. My dream is to work in the video game industry. My plans are to transfer to City College after I graduate to major in Computer Science. I want to become a Game Programmer. I've always had a passion for video games ever since I played on the NES back in the 90's. I currently play on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. If anybody has PS4, you can add my psn: AGRESiVA26. I play shooter and RPG games.
